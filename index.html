				<h2>Artwork based on the research of foodwaste in the U.S.</h2>
				<BR>
				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>The theme of food symbolizes many things that are too important to me. It signifies home, family, culture, and happiness. Food can also reveal a lot about a person and their background. However, I have decided to narrow down my research to
					focus on the concept of food waste in the U.S. In the past, I have dealt with food insecurity within my family, and my past experiences greatly shape my relationship with food. A few years ago, I began to work in a food service job and it
					has shown to me how much the U.S. contributes to food waste.

				<p>There are roughly 37 million people in the U.S. who are food insecure, yet large companies waste food when there are people who need it. Nonetheless, the current situation of our nation with the coronavirus has only exasperated the
					situation for people who suffer from insecurity. According to the article from Business Insider, Mass layoffs and furloughs have led to more Americans unsure about how they will put food on the table, by Barbara Smith the USDA estimates
					that about 17 million children will be unable to have access to nutritional food during this pandemic. Looking at this estimated statistic, how can make food that would otherwise be thrown away accessible to people who need it most during
					this pandemic? Will awareness of the amount of food being thrown away in the U.S. promote people to change our bad habits of food waste. </p>

				<p>As I have grown as an artist, I wish to explore further in my artwork how mass media, technology, the internet, etc…, affect the human psyche. Having grown up in the age of a technological boom, it's interesting to see how much technology
					has changed how people function and feel. This leads to another goal of mine as an artist, would be to illustrate the emotions and feelings that people have a hard time expressing in their lives.</p>

				<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture over ⅓ of all food, the US goes uneaten. Many crops are left unharvested due to labor shortages, unwanted stock in markets, and superficial imperfections. Many produces are tossed aside to
					rot because they do not fit the ideal shape, color, and size. The idea of the “perfect produce” began with the increase of the U.S. population and the U.S. market in the early 1960s. The standard of the “perfect produce” is still being
					implemented in the market today. The post-harvest loss not only affects the economic well-being of farmers as labor workers, but it is also a huge waste of environmental resources such as water and energy. </p>

				<p>Two photographers that discuss food waste in the U.S. through a creative outlet are Aliza Eliazarov and Klaus Pichler. Eliazarov is a New York-based photographer who creates luxurious still life with food that would have been tossed into
					the garbage. Eliazarov was inspired to recreate this garbage still life after she had watched a man salvage thrown away food from dumpsters in Harlem. Eliazarov focuses to highlight the beauty in the produce that is being tossed out.
					Pichler also adds to the concept by capturing the rotting process of food that has been thrown out in his project, One-Third. Alongside the portraits of rotting, food Pichler has descriptions of the production cost, style, source, and
					carbon footprint of the product. </p>

				<p>Previous artists who have approached the concept of food waste have captured the process of discarded food rotting to display the amount of food is being wasted to the public. I think it would be interesting to capture the rotten process
					in an AR. A city of rotten produce and products. From my research, I have learned that highly developed countries contribute to food waste to most and that most products that are discarded are ones that do not fit the standard of that
					product. Modeling a city with discarded and rejected food as the population would be an interesting way to exhibit the research I have done so far. This initial idea was inspired by the work of Jacolby Satterwhite, his work encompasses
					domestic household objects into the virtual
					space with performance and animations. Satterwhite creates a hallucinatory virtual reality in his work, this type of aesthetic would fit into the concept of food waste. Populations of large, developed countries are unaware of how much food
					waste they
					produce and how much food waste contributes to other global issues such as global warming and food insecurity. </p>

					<p>I plan for further investigation of the concept of food waste and its contributions to other global issues. For the remaining projects, I want to delve further into the issue of how produce is perfected and is selected. In addition to how crops are left in fields due to shortage of labor.</p>
