				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>As an artist, I try to focus on how to function as individuals in society. In my work, I wish to explore both the negative and positive ways our communities impact ourselves. That’s why I chose to work with the digital medium. Technology is more prevalent in the world than ever before so it is important to understand how we interact with it. The best way to express our relationship with technology is with the medium itself. We have learned how to use technology as a provider of information but also a way to express ideas and emotions artistically.

			<p>In the Digital Arts you have an ability to keep pushing an idea or concept further, to disassemble something and build it back up again as something entirely different. Within the digital, medium you have the ability to alter or rethink old ideas and concepts. And in the world today the digital world always has something new to offer and tinker around with, enabling endless creations. This idea as a whole has made me interested in the field of digital media.</p>

			<p>As I have grown as an artist, I wish to explore further in my artwork how mass media, technology, the internet, etc…, affect the human psyche. Having grown up in the age of a technological boom, it's interesting to see how much technology has changed how people function and feel. This leads to another goal of mine as an artist, would be to illustrate the emotions and feelings that people have a hard time expressing in their lives.</p>

			<p>I enjoy mixing traditional mediums for example wood, metal, sculpture with modern mediums such as video, websites and sound design. Working with both mediums helps connect my artwork by investigating the relationship between the real world and the virtual world.</p>
