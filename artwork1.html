				<h4>Ugly Produce City</h4>

				<p><b>Date:</b> 2020</p>

				<p><b>Dimension:</b> Fullscreen</p>

				<p><b>Mediums</b>: 3D-models made using Maya and Blender, A-frame</p>

				<p>
					<b>Description</b>: During my research, I uncovered that more than ⅓ of the world’s produce is thrown away, that's over 40 million tons of food thrown away in the U.S. every year. And with cities having larger populations generally generate
					food waste the most. In addition, large amounts of produce are thrown away before it even reaches the hands of the consumers. In many commercial farms produce is separated by fitting a certain “standard” size in order to bring the “perfect
					produce” to the American population. The other products that do not fit the ideal size and shape are often tossed away. Moreover, for my project I wanted to create a virtual city filled with “ugly produce as the population”, embodying the
					information that I learned during my research and to bring awareness to the amount of food wasted in cities. I was inspired to make a “virtual city” after looking at the work of Jacolby Satterwhite. Satterwhite’s virtual cities are
					populated with the 3D rendering of his mother’s drawings of household objects.

					<br></br>
					The process of making the virtual city was a very difficult one since it was my first time bringing 3D models to life in virtual environments. In the city, there are different renderings of “imperfect” produce populating the city, the
					“imperfect” leek and the “imperfect” pineapple. I originally created more models of different fruits and vegetables however, they were not rendering properly. There are also a few dumpsters and garbage bins in the scene to add to the fact
					that most of these “ugly produce” are tossed into landfills. I also added text to offer some statistical context to the viewer. The text reads in all caps, “ 40 MILLION TONS OF FOOD WASTED ON A CONSUMER LEVEL. MOST WASTE IS FROM LARGE
					CITIES. ⅓ OF THE WORLD’S FOOD IS TOSSED AWAY. MANY VEGETABLES THAT DO NOT FIT THE STANDARD ARE THROWN AWAY BEFORE REACHING COMMERCIAL MARKETS.” I originally had used the same text to create a texture for the ground in the scene, but the
					text was not as clear as I hoped it would be. In the future, I would like to improve this piece by adding more produce and changing the layout of the city.
